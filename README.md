## How to Run 
- Browse to the directory where you cloned this repository
- Open the .html file in a browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
- When the browser is loaded, all current vehicles associated with the MBA that are in transit will be displayed
- Initially, to show all vehicles, the map is zoomed out. To zoom, one can either use their scroll mouse, double click on the map, but not a marker, or if using a touch enabed device, use their fingers.
- The live data of the vehicles is updated every 15 seconds, but not populated to the map. This was left as a manual process. To refresh the location of the vehicles on the map, simply click on the button that states "Update location of public vehicles currently in transit".
- If you would like to gather more information on a particular vehicle, simply click on it's marker. It will provide you with the vehicle number, it's status, where it is in it's list of stops, it's availalbe occupancy, and the last time the data was updated.
